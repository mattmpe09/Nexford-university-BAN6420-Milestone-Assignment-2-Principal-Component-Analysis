## Instructions on how the script works
### First Step
Start by importing the necessary libraries which take care of the following.

* Load the breast cancer dataset from sklearn.datasets. 
* Standardizes the features by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance. 
* Performs principal component analysis for dimensionality reduction. 
* Classifies the algorithm to predict binary outcomes. 
* Split the dataset into training and testing sets. 
* Measures how well the classifier performs. 
### Second Step
* In this step the data set is loaded
### Third Step
•	The data is standardized to ensure each feature contributes equally to the PCA.
Fourth step
•	Computes the PCA and applies the transformation.
### Fifth Step
•	This step splits the data into training and testing
### Sixth Step
•	Training Logistic Regression
### Final step
•	Makes predictions and evaluates accuracy
